        "content": "A burning smell combined with an AC that has stopped working can indicate a few potential issues, often related to the AC system or electrical components. Let's narrow it down:\n\n1. **AC Compressor Failure**: If the compressor is seizing, it can produce a burning smell due to overheating. This could also cause the AC to stop functioning.\n\n2. **Electrical Short**: A burning smell could suggest that there\u2019s an electrical issue, possibly a short in the wiring or a malfunctioning component.\n\n3. **Belt Issues**: If the serpentine belt that drives the AC compressor is slipping or damaged, it might also generate a burning smell.\n\n### Steps to Diagnose and Repair:\n\n1. **Visual Inspection**:\n   - **Check the Serpentine Belt**: Open the bonnet and inspect the serpentine belt for any signs of wear, cracks, or fraying. If it's damaged, it should be replaced. The torque spec for the tensioner pulley is typically around 25-30 Nm, but check your vehicle's manual for specifics.\n   - **Look for Leaks**: Check around the AC compressor for any signs of oil or refrigerant leaks.\n\n2. **Listen for Unusual Noises**:\n   - Start the engine and turn on the AC. Listen for any grinding or squealing noises which may indicate a failing compressor or a slipping belt.\n\n3. **Electrical Check**:\n   - Inspect the AC fuse (refer to your owner's manual for the location). If it's blown, replace it and see if the AC starts working again. Fuses can be found at Halfords or Euro Car Parts, costing around \u00a35-15.\n\n4. **AC Compressor Test**:\n   - If you suspect the compressor is the issue, you can check its operation by using a diagnostic scanner. If the compressor clutch isn\u2019t engaging, it may need replacing. A new AC compressor typically costs between \u00a3150-400, plus labour (approximately \u00a350-80/hr).\n\n5. **Professional Diagnosis**:\n   - If you find nothing obvious or are uncomfortable performing these checks, it's best to take your car to a professional. A garage can run a complete diagnostic for around \u00a350-100.\n\n### Safety Note:\nIf you notice smoke or flames, stop the vehicle immediately and call for help. This can be a serious fire hazard.\n\n### Cost Estimate:\n- **Parts**: AC compressor (\u00a3150-400), serpentine belt (\u00a330-70), fuses (\u00a35-15).\n- **Labour**: Expect to pay around \u00a350-80/hr for any repairs.\n\nIf you can provide the make and model of your car, I can give more specific guidance!",
