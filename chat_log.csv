2025-10-15 21:03:50,SC24KWN,shsaky at high speeds ,"It sounds like your Renault is experiencing shaking or vibrations when you're driving at high speeds. This can be quite concerning, so let’s break down some possible causes and what you can do about it.

### Possible Causes:
1. **Worn Tyres**: If your tyres are unevenly worn or improperly balanced, they can cause shaking, especially at higher speeds.
2. **Wheel Alignment Issues**: If your wheels aren’t aligned properly, it can lead to vibrations.
3. **Brake Issues**: If the brake discs are warped or if there’s an issue with the brake pads, this can also cause shaking when you’re driving fast.
4. **Suspension Problems**: Worn out suspension components (like shocks or struts) can lead to instability and shaking.
5. **Drivetrain Issues**: Problems with the driveshaft or CV joints can also manifest as vibrations at speed.

### Steps to Diagnose:
1. **Check Tyres**:
   - Inspect for uneven wear, bulges, or low pressure. 
   - **DIY**: You can do a visual check and use a pressure gauge. If t",No,
2025-10-15 21:05:06,SC24KWN,thank you. this car is a van,"Got it! So, you’ve got a Renault van with a 1461cc diesel engine. The same advice applies, but let’s tailor it a bit for your van.

### Possible Causes of Shaking in Your Van:
1. **Tyres**: Just like with cars, uneven wear or incorrect balancing can lead to vibrations.
2. **Load Issues**: If your van is loaded unevenly or over its weight limit, it can cause instability at speed.
3. **Wheel Alignment**: Heavy use can knock the alignment out more easily in vans, especially if you’re driving on rough roads.
4. **Brake Problems**: Warped discs or worn pads can cause vibrations, especially when braking.
5. **Suspension**: The added weight in a van can wear out suspension components faster.

### Steps to Diagnose:
1. **Inspect the Tyres**:
   - Check for wear and ensure they’re inflated to the correct pressure. For vans, tyres might cost a bit more, around £70-£130 each.
   
2. **Check Load Distribution**:
   - Ensure your load is evenly distributed and not exceeding the van’s weight limit. ",No,
2025-10-15 21:10:32,YA12XLL,cuts out when in sports mode and goes into limp mode after having a remap,"I see you're having trouble with your BMW cutting out in sports mode and going into limp mode after a remap. This can be quite frustrating, especially since limp mode restricts your car's performance to protect the engine.

### Possible Causes:
1. **Turbo Issues:** As indicated by the whistling noise, your turbo might be failing or there could be a boost leak.
2. **ECU Issues:** The remap may have introduced compatibility issues with the engine's control unit (ECU).
3. **Fuel Supply Problems:** If the remap increased power without proper fuel supply adjustments, it could lead to cutting out.

### Practical Steps to Diagnose and Fix:

1. **Check for Fault Codes:**
   - Use an OBD-II scanner to check for any error codes. If you don’t have one, many garages offer a diagnostic service for around £30-£50.
   
2. **Inspect Turbo and Intercooler:**
   - Open the bonnet and visually inspect all intercooler hoses for splits or loose connections. If you find any damage, they will need to be repl",Yes,
2025-10-15 21:11:40,YA12XLL,there's no whistling noise,"Thanks for the clarification! If there’s no whistling noise, we’ll need to focus on other potential causes for your BMW cutting out in sports mode and going into limp mode.

### Possible Causes (Updated):
1. **ECU Compatibility:** The remap might not be compatible with your engine setup, which can lead to performance issues.
2. **Fuel Supply Issues:** This could involve a clogged fuel filter or a malfunctioning fuel pump.
3. **Air Intake Restrictions:** There could be an issue with the air intake system, such as a blocked air filter.
4. **Sensor Issues:** Faulty sensors, such as the mass airflow sensor (MAF) or throttle position sensor (TPS), can trigger limp mode.

### Steps to Diagnose and Fix:

1. **Check for Fault Codes:**
   - Start by using an OBD-II scanner to read any fault codes. If you don’t have a scanner, a garage can do this for about £30-£50. The codes will give you a clearer idea of what’s going wrong.

2. **Inspect Air Filter:**
   - Check the air filter for dirt or blo",Yes,
2025-10-15 21:13:48,N/A,why is my car shaking when braking?,"When your car shakes while braking, it can be quite concerning. Here are a few common reasons for this issue:

1. **Warped Brake Discs (Rotors)**: Over time, your brake discs can become uneven due to heat and wear, causing vibrations when you apply the brakes. This is one of the most common reasons for shaking. 
   - **DIY Check**: You can visually inspect the brake discs through the wheel spokes for any signs of warping.
   - **Cost**: Replacing brake discs can range from £100 to £300, depending on your car model.

2. **Worn Brake Pads**: If your brake pads are worn down unevenly, they can cause vibrations when you brake.
   - **DIY Check**: Look for any uneven wear on the pads, or listen for squeaking or grinding noises when braking.
   - **Cost**: Brake pad replacement typically costs between £50 to £150.

3. **Loose or Damaged Suspension Components**: Issues with parts like control arms, bushings, or ball joints can also lead to shaking.
