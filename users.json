            "content": "Thanks for providing the details about your 2015 Ford Fiesta with the P0420 code. This code indicates that the engine control module (ECM) has detected that the catalytic converter is not performing efficiently. Here are specific steps you can take to diagnose and potentially fix the issue:\n\n### Step-by-Step Diagnosis and Repair\n\n1. **Visual Inspection**:\n   - **Exhaust System**: Check for any visible leaks in the exhaust system, particularly before the catalytic converter. Look for cracks or loose connections in the exhaust pipes.\n   - **Oxygen Sensors**: Inspect the wiring and connectors for the front (pre-catalytic) oxygen sensor for any damage or corrosion.\n\n2. **Check O2 Sensor**:\n   - **Tools Needed**: OBD-II scanner, multimeter.\n   - **Testing**: Use an OBD-II scanner to check the live data from the front O2 sensor. It should vary between 0.1V and 0.9V as the engine runs. If it remains static, the sensor may be faulty.\n   - **Replacement**: If you determine the sensor is faulty, replace it with a new one (e.g., **Bosch 0 258 007 103**). Torque the sensor to manufacturer specifications (typically around **30 Nm**).\n\n3. **Check Catalytic Converter**:\n   - **Back Pressure Test**: If the O2 sensor is functioning correctly, you may need to check the catalytic converter for blockage. You can do this by measuring back pressure using a pressure gauge. The back pressure should be under **2 psi** at idle.\n   - **Replacement**: If the catalytic converter is faulty, you will need to replace it. A quality aftermarket converter can cost between **\u00a3150 and \u00a3400**, plus labour (around **\u00a350-80/hr**, typically 2-3 hours of work).\n\n4. **Check Fuel Trim**:\n   - **Tools Needed**: OBD-II scanner.\n   - **Testing**: Check the long-term fuel trim values. If they are consistently high (indicating a lean condition), further investigation into fuel delivery (fuel pump, filter, injectors) may be needed.\n   - **Fixing**: Depending on the findings, you may need to clean or replace the fuel filter and injectors.\n\n5. **Clear Codes and Test Drive**:\n   - After any repairs, clear the P0420 code using your OBD-II scanner and take the car for a test drive to see if the code returns.\n\n### Cost Estimates\n- **O2 Sensor Replacement**: \u00a350-\u00a3150 (parts and labour).\n- **Catalytic Converter Replacement**: \u00a3200-\u00a3600 (parts and labour).\n- **Fuel System Repairs**: Varies widely, typically \u00a3100-\u00a3300 depending on the issue.\n\n### Additional Notes\nIf you're not comfortable performing these diagnostics and repairs, or if the problem persists after your attempts, I recommend seeking professional assistance. A garage will have access to more advanced diagnostic tools to pinpoint the issue accurately. \n\nLet me know if you need further clarification on any of these steps!",
